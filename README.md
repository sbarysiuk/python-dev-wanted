=================

I'm looking for a good Python/Django developer (may be two) for our great team in Minsk.

You will be working with the best Python engineers on a great startup called Quote Roller (www.quoteroller.com). You'll be participating in all aspects of the project, including planning, product development, etc. but the primary responsibility will be Python/Django, front-end development and architecture.

Some cool technologies we're using in the app: Python, Django, Celery, Pisa, tons of great django apps (open source and home-backed), Fabric, HTML5/LESS, jQuery/UI, Backbone.js, etc. We have 16+ integrations with different systems like Google Apps, Basecamp, Subar CRM, Salesforce, Box, etc. 

Competitive salary, great team, cool offices in Minsk and San Francisco. Join the team, life is too short to work at a big boring company or to work alone. :)

Ping me at serge@quoteroller.com or via private messages. If you know someone, make a pull request or contact me :)
